# Manis Hugo Theme

It's a minimalist and responsive theme for Hugo Static Site Generator. It's
name taken from Indonesian Language for *Sweet*.

## Features

Like I said, it's really minimal (and lacking in documentation)

- Code Highlighting (HighlightJS)
- Social Icon Links
- Mobile First using Flexbox Grid
- Can be translated

## Translating String

Manis already translated to Bahasa Indonesia. But, if you want to translate this theme to your own language, look for the example in `i18n/en.yaml` and `i18n/in.yaml`.
